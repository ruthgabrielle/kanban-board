# Kanban Board with React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:


### `yarn` or `npm install`
To get all dependencies that I used.

### just for note
This project also uses 
* __Styled Components__ an ES6 and CSS library for style;
* __react-beautiful-dnd__ a higher level abstraction specifically built for lists, you can access [React Beautiful Dnd Docs](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd) for more information;
* __uuid__, universally unique identifier to generate new identifiers;
* __react-icons__  which utilizes ES6 imports that allows you to include only the icons that I've used, you can access [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) for more.
